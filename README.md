My name is Mizuki Katagiri and I look forward to working with you.  
I was born and raised in Nagaoka City, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, but I lived in Mie Prefecture when I was a student and in Saitama Prefecture for about 10 years after joining TaKT.  

My hobbies are  
Rugby (Used to be a player, now I'm a spectator).  

Mountain climbing.  

Jogging (I run about 50 kilometers a week).  

Wine (I like wines from Nagano and Yamanashi).  

Coffee (I like Komuro Special from Yanaka Coffee).

ðŸ¥ŒFavorite motto.
```
Iâ€™m a good programmer.
I have confidence.
Letâ€™s have fun!
```
